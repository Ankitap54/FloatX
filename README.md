### Problem Statement Info

1. PROJECT ID - SIH1625
2. THEME - SMART AUTOMATION
3. TITLE - SMART CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO ENHANCE EDUCATION.

## PROPOSED SOLUTION / PROJECT IDEA 

We are creating a smart classroom management system for enhance education with these initial feature's mention below - 

* >SMART ATTENDANCE SYSTEM 
* >INTERACTIVE LEARNING 
* >SAFETY AND SECURITY. 
* >RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 
* >DATA ANALYTICS 

### SMART ATTENDANCE SYSTEM. 

SMART ATTENDANCE SYSTEM A SYSTEM WHERE WE CAN USE AUTOMATION TO TAKING ATTENDANCE INSTEAD OF MANUAL
WORK , SUCH AS FACIAL RECOGNISATION , FINGERPRINT CENSOR AND ALL. 
ALTHOUGH, SUCH THINGS ARE ALREADY EXIST, BUT EVERY INSTITUTE CANNOT AFFORD IT DUE TO
IT COST. IT MAY COULD BE EXPENSIVE FOR MANY SMALL LEVEL INSTITUTION

HENCE WE, WE ARE DEVELOPING AN SMART ATTENDANCE SYSTEM WHERE IF INSTITUTION DOES NOT HAVE 
HARDWARE FOR IT , THE TEACHER CAN USE THEIR MOBILE PHONE CAMERA TO RECOGNISE THE STUDENT'S
ATTENDANCE. ALSO IT WILL HAVE MANUAL CONTROL FOR TEACHER/EDUCATOR HOW HE/SHE WANTS TO TAKE 
THE ATTENDANCE. 

#### Another Idea.
 
Primary , We were about to develop an GPS based attendance system , where students needs to 
keep their gps on in classroom, and mark their attendance by their self. 
If student is in college or in the campus of institution , attendance will be marked , otherwise it will denied.
**To prevent** Student from just marking proxy and go out of the college, We were about to introduce 
an system that will check their location multiple times during lecture.
Also , **To prevent** software error, We were about to give control to the teacher/educator for that as well.
